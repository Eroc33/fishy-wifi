Mission, deadlines, team members
===

We're working to get more local pockets of sustainable food production out
there using aquaponics. The more distributed food supplies are, the more
resilient our communities will become. The less we use scarce resources, the
more sustainable we'll be.

To do this we're trying to boost awareness of aquaponics, and to get a bunch
of systems out there (in the UK and elsewhere) that incorporate our WaterElf
device. These will gather the data (in _citizen science_) to be able to say
more precisely what we can grow in our local conditions, and what it costs.

On September 1st we'll launch our Kickstarter campaign, WeGrow, to help
develop the electronics and on-line community, to deliver training courses
(via our partners), and to supply complete aquaponics systems.
