How much Lua code can we fit on the ESP?

This isn't really a bug... more of a contribution to documentation.

There is a hard limit on code size that NodeMCU can support. If we try to load
a chunk that exceeds that size then the system restarts.

To replicate, copy the files sizebug100.lua and sizebug300.lua to the ESP.
Then

    sb = require("sizebug100")

This will succeed. Then try

    sb = require("sizebug300")

This will trigger a reboot...

Tested with:

    hardware -- ESP-01 module, Olinex ESP dev board
    
    software -- nodemcu_20150107.bin available github, and also the latest
    checkins as of Jan 13th 2015
    
    tools used -- ESPlorer build 206 on Ubuntu 14.04/Mint Debian
