ARDuino meets ESP...

Procedure for installing Arduino environment to use ESP8266 chip: (from
https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino)

- Install Arduino 1.6.4 or later from the Arduino website.
- Make sure you have permissions on the port that the ESP is connected via,
  e.g. sudo adduser yourname dialout
- Start Arduino and open Preferences window.
- Enter http://arduino.esp8266.com/staging/package_esp8266com_index.json into
  Additional Board Manager URLs field.
  - Or, for the latest version, use a locally built version or the staging
    release -- see http://www.esp8266.com/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=3919
- Set the Arduino dir to fishy-wifi/ardesp/Arduino if required
- Open Boards Manager from Tools > Board menu and install esp8266 platform
  (and don't forget to select your ESP8266 board from Tools > Board menu after
  installation).
- For the Adafruit HUZZAH ESP board, we use a CPU frequency of 80MHz, 3M SPIFFS,
  upload speed of 115200.
