With 5v sensors we need a potential divider with a ratio of 5 to match the 1V ADC on the ESP.

Resistors used are 30K and 120K like this:

Sensor --- 120K ----ADC----30K----GND

The pressure sensor has a 4.5V-0.5V range for 1.2MPa max

The current sensor is more complex, with a potential divider of ratio of 4.3

Resistors used are 68K and 30K

with a burden resistor of
3.3*2000/1*30*sqr(2)= 155.56 ohms needed across the coil,
we used 100+56 ohms.

Our sensor was a 2000:1 30A max version:
